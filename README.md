Machine learning in pure C, spelled out.

Current projects:
* `parallelisms/` -- Parallelize MLP training in pure C with OpenMPI. Plan is to support data parallel, 
  [fully sharded data parallel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11277), [tensor parallel](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08053), 
  and pipeline parallel.
* `plotting/` -- random math and plotting utilities with SDL2.
* `tf_idf.c` -- [TF/IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) implementation in pure C.
